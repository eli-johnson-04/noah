# Noah
The training application for Ghana's Ark Foundation team on website maintenance. 

### Development
This is an Electron app running React. It also uses Concurrently and Wait-On so that the app can be edited in the development environment. 

To get started, clone the repo and navigate to noah/noah-electron. Open the terminal and run the command:
```npm run electron-react```
This will start the development environment. 

After exiting out of the Electron window, be sure to press Ctrl+C, then use "y" twice to fully exit the development environment and return to the terminal.
