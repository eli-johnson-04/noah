### Development
This is an Electron app running React and TailwindCSS.

To get started, clone the repo and navigate to the root. Open the terminal and run the command:  
```npm install```   
to ensure all dependencies are installed.   

Then, run:  
```npm run electron-react```  
This will start the development environment.

After exiting out of the Electron window, be sure to press Ctrl+C to exit the development environment and return to the terminal.
